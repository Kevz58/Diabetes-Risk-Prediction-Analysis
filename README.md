# Diabetes-Risk-Prediction-Analysis

A comprehensive machine learning analysis of diabetes risk factors using the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2021 dataset. This project implements multiple predictive modeling approaches to identify key risk factors for diabetes and pre-diabetes.

**Project Overview**
This study analyzes diabetes risk prediction through three main hypotheses:

1. Lifestyle Risk Factors: Impact of smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and diet
2. Socioeconomic Factors: Effects of income, education, age, and gender
3. Health History Factors: Influence of blood pressure, cholesterol, BMI, and cardiovascular conditions

**Key Features**

- Multiple ML Approaches: Logistic Regression, CART Decision Trees, LASSO Regression, Random Forest
- Recall-Optimized Models: Prioritizes detection of positive diabetes cases for medical screening
- Class Imbalance Handling: Implements undersampling techniques for balanced datasets
- Comprehensive Visualization: Correlation matrices, decision trees, performance metrics
- Rigorous Validation: 10-fold cross-validation and hyperparameter optimization
